            <h2>About This Tool</h2>
            <p>This open-source tool generates AIBOM (AI Bill of Materials) for models hosted on Hugging Face. It
                automatically extracts and formats key information about AI models into a standardized, machine-readable
                SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) using the CycloneDX JSON format. Because metadata quality varies
                across models and much of the information is unstructured, the tool analyzes what is available,
                organizes it into a consistent structure, and provides an AIBOM completeness score that evaluates how
                well the model is documented. This helps users quickly understand documentation gaps and supports
                transparency, security, and compliance. The tool is also listed on <a

            <h2>Understanding AIBOMs</h2>
            <p>An AIBOM (Artificial Intelligence Bill of Materials, also known as AI/ML-BOM, AI SBOM, or SBOM for AI) is
                a detailed, structured inventory that lists the components and dependencies involved in building and
                operating an AI system—such as pre-trained models, datasets, libraries, and configuration parameters.
                Much like a traditional SBOM for software, an AIBOM brings transparency to what goes into an AI system,
                enabling organizations to assess security, compliance, and ethical risks. It is essential for managing
                AI supply chain risks, supporting regulatory requirements, ensuring model provenance, and enabling
                incident response and audits. As AI systems grow more complex and widely adopted, AIBOMs become critical
                for maintaining trust, accountability, and control over how AI technologies are developed, integrated,
                and deployed.</p>
